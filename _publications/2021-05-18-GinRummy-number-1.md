permalink: /publication/2021-05-18-GinRummy-number-1
excerpt: 'This paper describes the design and training of a computer Gin Rummy player. The system includes three main components to make decisions about drawing cards, discarding, andending the game, with numerous parameters controlling behavior. In particular, an ensemble approach is explored in thediscard decision. Finally, three sets of parameter tuning andperformance experiments are analyzed.
