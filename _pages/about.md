I'm a Ph.D. student in Quantitative Biology at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, under the guidance of Dr. [Peter Koo](https://koolab.cshl.edu/). My research focuses on exploring the inner workings of deep learning models to uncover the biological knowledge these models have extracted and identify the models' uncertainty. My interests span mechanistic interpretability, active learning, and model evaluation. Additionally, I am committed to ensuring the safety of artificial intelligence and biotechnology.
