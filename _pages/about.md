I am an undergraduate student at DePauw University who majors in bioinformatics (an interdisciplinary major that combines biochemistry and computer science courses), where I have been working with <b>Daniel Gurnon</b>, <b>Chad Byers</b>, and <b>[David Harvey](http://dpuadweb.depauw.edu/harvey_web/index.html)</b>. My main interest lies in the application of machine learning or data science techniques to biological data such as data on genome, mutation, health.

I work as a software engineer that develops bioinformatics tools mainly for reserach. I have developed a tool that reflects mutations and splicing junctions on input data and outputs predicted transcripts and open reading frames, a database for animal insurance data, and several pipelines for RNA-seq, Reseq, structural variant detection, and etc.
